## Description
This is a Dash web application for performing analysis on stocks. The application provides three main features:

Main Page: Allows users to select one or more stocks from a dropdown menu, choose a date range, and view a plot of the adjusted close prices for the selected stocks over the chosen date range.
Monte Carlo Simulation: Users can select a single stock, specify the number of days and runs for the simulation, and then view a plot of a Monte Carlo simulation based on this information.
Correlation Comparison: Users can select two stocks and view a scatter plot showing the correlation between the percentage changes in the adjusted closing prices of the two stocks.

## Installation

```bash
pip install dash pandas pandas_datareader yfinance numpy seaborn plotly
